# Git-CheatSheet-App-Android
A very basic app that has Git Cheat Sheet in a nice readable layout. This app is created just to learn and practice the concept of scroll views and linear layout  (both horizontal and vertical). The cheat sheat content used in the app is taken from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet).<br>
<b>This app is made just for practice and is not intended for any commercial distribution.</b> <br>
